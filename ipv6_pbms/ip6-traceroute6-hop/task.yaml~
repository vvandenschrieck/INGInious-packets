    ICMPv6, described in the `IPv6 chapter <http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/2nd/html/protocols/ipv6.html#icmp-version-6>`_ of `Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice <http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/>`_ is a companion protocol for IPv6 that is used for various functions including network debugging. `traceroute6` is a popular debugging tool that allows to trace the path towards a destination.
